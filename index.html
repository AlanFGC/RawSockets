<!--h3>Welcome!</h3-->
<p>I am an associate professor in the <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Khoury College of Computer
Sciences at Northeastern University</a>, Executive Director of the <a href="https://cyber.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute</a>, and 
    affiliate faculty at the <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/clic/">Center for Law, Innovation and Creativity (CLIC)</a>. 
    My research is primarily in the areas of distributed systems and
networking, with a recent focus on privacy, security, transparency, and mobile systems.     
</p>
<p>
    My research approach is to combine science and engineering to understand and improve the performance, reliability, and security of Internet systems. With respect to science, I empirically measure computer systems that interact over the Internet to understand how well they match existing models and assumptions, then investigate the root causes for violations of those models/assumptions—often then leading to the design of new models. In many cases, our observations also suggest the design of systems that exploit previously unknown information about how our Internet-enabled systems work, and as an engineer I build and evaluate such systems in a way that other researchers, users, and policy makers can benefit from the result. To date, the software artifacts of my research have more than one million users, and my research teams have produced reports and datasets that informed additional research, policy debates, regulators, and legislators.

  </li> 
  <li><span class="label label-success">6/29/21</span> Time for another batch update on things that have happened since... a while ago: <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Our paper titled <i>AnyOpt: Predicting and Optimizing IP Anycast Performance</i>, was accepted for publication at SIGCOMM 2021.
             This was fantastic work led by Shane (Xiao) Zhang at Duke, along with Tanmoy Sen, Zheyuan Zhang, Tim April, Balakrishnan Chandrasekaran, Bruce M. Maggs,  Haiying Shen, Ramesh K. Sitaraman, and Xiaowei Yang. 
             We show how you don't have to compromise on latency performance when building an anycast-based service.
             <li>Our paper titled <a href="https://moniotrlab.ccis.neu.edu/pets21/">Blocking without Breaking: Identification and Mitigation of Non-Essential IoT Traffic</a> was accepted to appear in PETS 2021. 
             Learn how we can block unnecessary IoT traffic to reduce privacy and security issues. Joint work with Anna Maria Mandalari (Imperial College London), Daniel J. Dubois (Northeastern University), Roman Kolcun (Imperial College London), Muhammad Talha Paracha (Northeastern University), Hamed Haddadi (Imperial College London).
             <li>Our prototype proposal “IoTrimmer: Defending against IoT privacy threats” reached the TOP 10 (among 180 submissions) at the <a href="https://telekom-challenge.com/">Telekom Challenge by T-Labs</a>. We're planning to make our privacy- and security-enhancing technology into a product for widespread use.
             <li>Theo Benson and I will be the Program Committee co-Chairs for the 2022 Internet Measurement Conference. I can't wait to see everyone's fascinating submissions!
             <li>I am part of a team that has been awarded a $10M NSF SaTC Frontier grant for improving privacy via a multimodal, interdisciplinary approach. Learn more about our project at: <a href="https://properdata.eng.uci.edu/">https://properdata.eng.uci.edu/</a>  
        </ul>
    <li><span class="label label-success">9/9/20</span> It's been a busy pandemic, and there quite a few updates since last time: <br>
        <ul>
            <li>I spent my sabbatical as a Security Architect at Akamai Technologies. I learned a great deal and worked with extremely talented and welcoming people.</li>
            <li>My team's work on smart speakers inadvertently waking up was published and presented at PETS 2020. You learn more about it <a href="https://moniotrlab.ccis.neu.edu/smart-speakers-study-pets20/">here</a>.</li>
            <li>Along with collaborators from the UK, and Germany, my team's work on detecting IoT devices from highly sampled network traffic was accepted to IMC 2020. You can find a preprint <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01880">here</a>.</li>
            <li>I'm now an affiliate faculty member at Northeastern's <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/law/academics/institutes/clic/index.html">Center for Law, Innovation and Creativity (CLIC)</a>. I'm thrilled to join such an esteemed group of collegues and work with them at the intersection of empirical neworking research and consumer protection policy. </li>
        </ul>
    <li><span class="label label-success">2/20/20</span> Happy to announce that <a href="pubs/flowprint_ndss20.pdf">FlowPrint</a> will appear in NDSS 2020! This project focuses on an approach to fingerprinting apps based ono network traffic that works both in semi-supervised and entirely unsuperrvised settings. This is joint work led by Thijs van Ede, along with Riccardo Bortolameotti, Andrea Continella, Jingjing Ren, Daniel Dubois, Martina Lindorfer, Maarten van Steen, Andreas Peter.
    <li><span class="label label-success">7/19/19</span> Very excited to report that two papers I coauthored will appear at <a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2019/">IMC 2019</a>. 
        <ul>
            <li>In <b>Information Exposure From Consumer IoT Devices: A Multidimensional, Network-Informed Measurement Approach</b>, led by my recently graduated PhD student Dr. Jingjing Ren, we conduct a multidimensional analysis of privacy exposure from 81 devices located in labs in the US and UK, using more than 34,000 automated and manual experiments. We characterize privacy exposure in terms of destinations of Internet traffic, whether the contents of communication are protected by encryption, what are the IoT-device interactions that each destination learns about, and whether there are unexpected exposures of sensitive information (eg video surreptitiously transmitted by a recording device). This is joint work with Daniel J. Dubois, Anna Maria Mandalari, Roman Kolcun, and Hamed Haddadi.</li> 
            <li>In <b>RPKI is Coming of Age: A Longitudinal Study of RPKI Deployment and Invalid Route Origins</b>, led by former NEU postdoc Taejoong Chung, we study the evolution of the RPKI deployment using a unique dataset containing all RPKI Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs) from the moment RPKI was first deployed. We find that the RPKI has seen a rapid increase in adoption over the past two years, and recently misconfigurations are rare, meaning that the deployment is ready for prime time and ready for ISPs to drop RPKI invalid routes. This is joint work with Emile Aben, Tim Bruijnzeels, Balakrishnan Chandrasekaran, Dave Levin, Bruce Maggs, Alan Mislove, Roland van Rijswijk-Deij, John P. Rula, and Nick Sullivan.</li>
        </ul>
    <li><span class="label label-success">6/7/19</span> Tenure achievement unlocked! I am beyond excited to report that the President and Board of Trustees of Northeastern University have approved my promotion to Associate Professor with tenure. I have so many people to thank, including all of
75d
 my outstanding <a href="https://david.choffnes.com/collaborators.php">collaborators</a> and colleagues, and of course my family for supporting me along this long and fruitful journey.

<h3>Cetera</h3>
<p>Pronouns: He/him.</p>

<p>
	For those who don't know me, the following passage has become a theme
	that runs through my life. In short, I "push the rock," just like <a
		href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus">Sisyphus</a> from Greek
	mythology. But Camus tells it better:
</p>

<div style="margin-left: 1em; font-style: italic">As for this myth, one
	sees merely the whole effort of a body straining to raise the huge
	stone, to roll it and push it up a slope a hundred times over; one sees
	the face screwed up, the cheek tight against the stone, the shoulder
	bracing the clay-covered mass, the foot wedging it, the fresh start
	with arms outstretched, the wholly human security of two earth-clotted
	hands. At the very end of his long effort measured by skyless space and
	time without depth, the purpose is achieved. Then Sisyphus watches the
	stone rush down in a few moments toward that lower world whence he will
	have to push it up again toward the summit. He goes back down to the
	plain. It is during that return, that pause, that Sisyphus interests
	me. A face that toils so close to stones is already stone itself! I see
	that man going back down with a heavy yet measured step toward the
	torment of which he will never know the end. That hour like a
	breathing-space which returns as surely as his suffering, that is the
	hour of consciousness. At each of those moments when he leaves the
	heights and gradually sinks toward the lairs of the gods, he is
	superior to his fate. He is stronger than his rock.</div>
